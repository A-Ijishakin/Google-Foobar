# Google-Foobar
The Google foobar is a secret hiring challenge which google sends out to indivdiuals based on their (programming related) google searches. The challenge is comprised of 5 levels of difficulty. It has a pyramid structure for the amount of challenges, the first level has 1 challenge, the second has 2, the third 3, fourth 2 and fifth 1. Naturally, as the levels progress the complexity progresses, with the fifth level being highly challenging. This repository contains solutions for the google foobar coding challenge up until level three currently. 

As I progress through the levels, I will comtinue to post the solutions on here. All solutions have been coded in python, and a description of the challenge is posted at the top of the .py file.
